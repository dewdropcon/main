<h2>About DEW Drop Construction</h2>
<p>
DEW Drop Construction is more than just a company — it is a family legacy shaped through years of experience, dedication, and craftsmanship. Based in Marondera, Zimbabwe, we proudly deliver top-tier construction services including painting, plumbing, tiling, renovations, and general building work.
</p>
<p>
The company was founded by two brothers: <strong>Kevin Mutero</strong>, the elder brother known for his leadership, precision, and deep technical knowledge, and <strong>Blessing Mutero</strong>, the younger brother whose creativity and innovative problem-solving elevate every project. Their journey began long before DEW Drop was established — they were trained hands-on by their father, who taught them practical construction techniques, discipline, and pride in craftsmanship.
</p>
<p>
Today, Kevin and Blessing carry that legacy forward with modern techniques, intuitive design thinking, and a commitment to innovation. Their combined strengths make DEW Drop Construction a company rooted in tradition but built for the future.
